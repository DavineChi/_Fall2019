Name and email address
Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary a
key-value pairs. The program should display a menu that lets the user
look up a person’s email address, add a new name and email address,
change an existing email address and delete an existing name and email
address. The program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file
when the user exists the program. Each time the program starts it should
retrieve the dictionary from the file and unpickle it.
